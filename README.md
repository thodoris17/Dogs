# Dogs coding challenge

## INTRODUCTION

I want to mention that before starting, I timesloted this assignment to 3-5 hrs.
In that timespan I didn't want to create something extra complicated, but mostly to show my view on code quality, testing and in general structure.
( tldr; Don't expect fancy UI :) )
